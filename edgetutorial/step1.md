This step basically set up the environment necessary.

Initially we can create a folder to which we will be cloning the base code

`mkdir kubeedge`{{execute}}

Switch to the created directory and create the src directory(for GOPATH setting)

`cd kubeedge`{{execute}}

`mkdir src`{{execute}}

Set GOPATH for working

`export GOPATH=/root/kubeedge`{execute}}

Verify whether your GOPATH is set correctly

`echo $GOPATH`{{execute}}
